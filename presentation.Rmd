## A Little Bit About Me

> - Software engineer at RStudio; started about one year ago
> - Completed an MSc. in Statistics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), under the tutelage of [Jenny Bryan](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/)
> - Worked briefly in data analytics roles in labs in Vancouver, BC and at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA  (primarily with large genomic datasets)
> - Began programming with `R`; slowly drifted towards `C++` (through Rcpp); fiddled with other languages as well

## What I do at RStudio

> - I primarily work on the IDE itself, but also maintain the [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package,

> - I read the kind (and mean) things people say on Twitter about the RStudio IDE, and incorporate suggestions / fixes when possible or feasible,

> - I occasionally break the daily builds (for those of you brave enough to try them out...)

## Why RStudio v0.99 is Exciting

With this release of RStudio, we've been very ambitious in terms of new features:

> - Hugely improved data viewer (View more than 1000 rows! Filter and sort!)
> - Vastly improved autocompletion system (smarter, fuzzier, and with more contexts)
> - Diagnostics, to warn you if (and when) you make a mistake
> - Snippets, for easy insertion of boilerplate (and otherwise)
> - Source editor improvements (updated Vim mode, multiple cursors, tab reordering, new themes)

## Data Viewer

We had started to notice, at various R meetups, that almost everyone had a data viewer open in their IDE ...

... even though it was a severely limited view (non-interactive, only 1000 rows, kind of ugly).

With RStudio v0.99, we've completely overhauled the data viewer, and it is much more powerful than before. Let's give it a spin.

## R Code Completion

Back when I was working as a data analyst, it drove me insane that code completion here worked:

        rnorm(n = 1, |
    
but not here:

        rnorm(n = 1,
              |

Why should it matter if my cursor is on a separate line!?

## R Code Completion

This was one of the primary things we wanted to fix with the autocompletion system, but we also wanted to tool it in a way to support popular emerging packages.

For example -- using packages that make heavy use of non-standard evaluation, e.g. [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) and [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table), can benefit greatly with improved autocomplete.

But we also wanted to improve the autocompletion experience, regardless of what packages you were using.

## R Code Completion

The gist of it: our autocompletion system now supports:

- Multiline autocompletions,

- Omni-completion, of all variables 'implicitly in scope', by examining the source document,

- Completions for array / matrix dimension names,

- Completions within so-called 'pipe' chains (with special tooling for `dplyr` 'verbs'),

- Improved file completions (recursively list all files within the project),

- Fuzzy narrowing (be lazy, make spelling mistakes and let RStudio fix it for you)

## R Code Completion

There's one other feature which may be a little bit difficult to appreciate ...

... we now have a mechanism for providing completions from a particular package, _even if it's not loaded_.

Let's see that in action as well.

## R Code Completion

It's also worth saying -- we now have (far less sophisticated, but still helpful) autocompletion for other languages as well.

So, if you need to dip into SQL, JavaScript, Python, RStudio can still do a somewhat reasonable job of providing you with completion items.

## Diagnostics

We probably saw the diagnostics kick in a bit during the demos, as I (inevitably) made errors in the interactive examples.

We now have a system that parses and checks your code in the background, to alert you of errors (or misplaced commas) as soon as we can.

This feature is still a bit in flux -- diagnosing R code is incredibly difficult due to the use of non-standard evaluation -- but we'll get there!

## Snippets

Snippets are typically much more essential in boiler-plate heavy languages (for example, Java). However, there are still a couple useful (and fun) situations where snippets can help us.

One of the coolest (and most dangerous) features of the snippets is that you can execute your own custom R code, thereby making it possible to do ... well, nearly anything, based on the text you insert.

## C++, Rcpp Completions + Diagnostics

[Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/) is a package that acts as a bridge between the R and C++ worlds -- it makes it incredibly easy to write C++ code, and expose that functionality back to R.

A common criticism of R is that it is slow. It can be. But when it is, it's very easy to dip into `Rcpp` and write the routines that you need to be fast.

## Other Goodies

There's a number of other minor yet useful features that will find their way into the RStudio v0.99 release that are worth exploring here:

- Automagic generation of Roxygen skeletons for functions

- Vim ex-command support for common commands (and `R`)

- Automatic code reformatting (turn your collaborators ugly R code into works of art)

- Fuzzy file finding (and it accepts line numbers)

## Looking Towards v1.0

We're getting close! There are a number of features we want to tackle for v1.0, or soon after:

- Move away from the four-panel layout -- allow users to tear out the source pane, and have multiple source editors open at once.
- Support for multiple `R` sessions, with the ability to 'attach' and 'detach to each `R` session as desired.
- Feature requests from the community -- ie, you!
